Today we will try with a new algorithm - Z algorithm

This algo is used in pattern matching,there is another algo for pattern matching

This algorithm works in O(length of text+length of pattern) complexity

and space complexity is similar to time complexity that means O(length of text+length of pattern)

This algorithm is very easy.
